The application utilizes the React Dropzone library to allow users to easily upload files in both JSON and CSV formats. Once the file is uploaded, the application employs the PapaParse library to parse and display the data in a table. This table provides a clear and organized visualization of the data, making it easier for users to read and analyze.

Furthermore, the application provides a search field (Filter) that enables users to filter data based on specific criteria. This functionality is particularly beneficial for Human Resources (HR) professionals who wish to quickly find candidates or specific information within the uploaded data.

Finally, the application includes a chart representing data on salaries requested by candidates. The chart offers a visual representation of salary distributions, allowing users to obtain a quick and intuitive analysis of the information.

In summary, the application offers a comprehensive experience for uploading, visualizing, and analyzing candidate data, with interactive tools such as the table and chart to streamline the decision-making process for HR recruiters.
